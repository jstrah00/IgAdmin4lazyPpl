Lamborghini has just unveiled a special Aventador S \"dressed\" by Yohji Yamamoto, in occasion to the grand opening of the LOUNGE TOKYO and also to celebrate the partnership between the two brands.\n\nThe car has been created with the help of the Centro Stile and the Ad Personam department, and it shows a really customized configuration that takes inspiration from Yohji Yamamoto's capsule collection which includes three exclusive clothes.
